                Monica graduated from college with an associates in accounting and shortly 
                thereafter began an internship as an accounting clerk. Thanks to her

                and became a team lead. In the fall of 2020, she began to study programming 
                for fun, but as her interest deepened, she decided to enroll in Hackbright’s 
                prep course to learn the basics of Python. After completion, she began her 
                studies at Hackbright Academy’s full-stack developer program. Monica is passionate 
                about learning about new technologies, problem-solving, and collaborating with
                other engineers. She hopes to continue learning and developing 
                her backend software engineering skills after graduation. Monica hopes to 
                continue learning and practicing her backend software engineering skills
